**Project Overview** 

This project involved a comprehensive analysis of a multinational digital advertising campaign for a confidential client in the marketing sector.
The campaign spanned several countries across North America and Africa over the course of 2023.
As a Data Analyst, I used Power BI to transform raw ad performance data into a strategic decision-making tool,
enabling marketing executives to optimise budgets, improve engagement, and significantly increase campaign efficiency across different markets.

**Project Goals**

The goals of the project are to: 
- Uncover trends and insights from monthly ad performance data across countries.
- Evaluate marketing efficiency using key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Identify underperforming regions and recommend cost-saving strategies.
- Highlight high-performing regions for campaign scaling.
- Equip marketing stakeholders with a live dashboard to track campaign progress in real-time.

**Tools & Techniques used** 
- Power BI (Data modeling, DAX, dashboarding)
- Excel (Initial cleaning, validation)
- Power Query (Data transformation)
- DAX Measures (For custom KPIs like ROI, CTR rankings, and time-based trends)
- Slicer & Drill-Down Visuals (For intuitive interaction)

**Key Metrics Analysed**
- Ad Spend is the Total amount spent on ads per region/month
- CPM	Cost per 1,000 impressions — indicates brand visibility cost
- CPC	Cost per click — helps assess conversion potential
- CTR (%)	Click-through rate — reflects how engaging the ad was
- Ad Reach is the	Total number of unique users who saw the ad
- Ad Clicks	Number of users who clicked the ad

**Analysis Highlights**

Regional Trends: North America saw higher CPM and CPC values, but also had stronger CTRs. 
This indicated that while costlier, the audience in those regions was more engaged.

Cost Efficiency in Africa: African countries such as Egypt demonstrated a lower CPC and CPM, 
with decent CTRs, identifying them as cost-efficient markets with growth potential.

Performance by Month: Engagement metrics peaked during Q2 (April–June), aligning with key campaign periods,
revealing seasonal trends in digital ad effectiveness.

Underperforming Regions: Several high-spend regions delivered below-average CTRs, 
leading to targeted budget cuts and retargeting strategies.

**Dashboard Features**
- Interactive Slicers by Continent, Country, and Month.
- KPI Cards for average CPC, CPM, CTR, Ad Spend, Reach, and Clicks.
- Total Ad reach Performers Visualization by country.
- Total Ad reach Performers Visualization by continent.
- Time-Series Trends to track monthly fluctuations.

**Business Impact**

Following the insights derived from this analysis:

- The organisation was able to reallocate 17% of the global marketing budget from underperforming
  regions to high-engagement countries, improving ad ROI.
- Average CTR improved by 12% in the following quarter due to focused ad targeting based on high-performance countries.
- Marketing managers used the dashboard to make data-driven budget shifts in real time, enabling quick reaction to underperforming trends.
- The dashboard became a core reporting tool during executive meetings, reducing manual reporting time by over 60%.
- Africa, previously underutilised in ad spending, became a key focus region, expanding organisation's reach
  with lower cost-per-click metrics and a growing digital audience.

**Key Recommendations**

I recommended that the organisation should:
- Prioritise campaigns in high-CTR countries (e.g., Canada, Egypt, U.S.).
- Reallocate funds monthly using the dashboard’s ROI trend analysis.
- Run seasonal campaigns during high engagement months (Q2).
- Reduce or restructure spend in low-performing regions based on CPC and CTR.
  
### Final Thoughts
This project not only delivered business-transforming insights but also demonstrated how data visualization and strategic KPIs 
can bridge the gap between raw data and effective marketing decisions. It stands as a robust example of my ability to combine data storytelling, 
analytical modeling, and dashboard design to support executive-level strategy.
